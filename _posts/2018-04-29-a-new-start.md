It has been awhile since I have touched this, about over a month actually. That is okay though, because fun things are happening. For starters, my [itch.io](https://devlinmcclure.itch.io) page is up with a small project called  [ESCAPE!: A Game of Boxes](https://devlinmcclure.itch.io/escape-a-game-of-boxes). Check it out, download the source code over at  [GitHub](https://github.com/devmcclu/ESCAPE-A-Game-of-Boxes) as well. Other than that, the school year is winding down, and my plans for the summer are make more games. Simple, right? Check out my twitter [@Devlin_McClure](https://twitter.com/Devlin_McClure) to keep up with whatever I post there. Might even start streaming game development stuff over at Mixer, so look out for that as well. Don't have much else to say, but this feels like a new start to a cool little summer.
