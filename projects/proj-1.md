title: 'Gamedev @ IU: TechSIG Officer - July 2018 to Present'
---

Gamedev @ IU is Indiana University Bloomington's student organization for game developers, new and experienced. I am one of the founding members of the Tech Special interest group, where we focus on the programming and technical aspects of video game production. As an Officer of the Tech SIG, I create materials to teach and discuss topics in video game technology with a focus on open source tools such as Git.
