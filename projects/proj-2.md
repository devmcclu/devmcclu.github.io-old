#Hoosier Games: Semester Team - September 2017 to December 2017

Indiana Universityâ€™s game production club, where I led a small team on a game idea of my creation. I worked on setting goals for the team, helping program in Unity, and creating presentations at milestones. This project helped me learn project scope.
