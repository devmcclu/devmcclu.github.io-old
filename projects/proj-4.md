# ESCAPE! A Game of Boxes 

This is a game made in the first Hoosier Games Bi-weekly jams, with the theme "Outside the Box." The goal of the game is to get to the top of the level, of which there are four, by placing blocks in the level. This was an experimentation in the 2D physics of the Godot Engine.

### Solo Project

### Tools used
1. Godot Engine (GDScript)
